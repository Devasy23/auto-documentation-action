# AI_CONTEXT.md

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a multi-language example demonstrating basic functionalities, potentially as part of a larger system or tutorial. It includes examples written in Go, TypeScript, and Python, suggesting a focus on cross-language interoperability or showcasing different approaches to the same problem. The presence of `ai_api_helper.py` hints at interaction with an external AI API.  The examples directory contains simple programs (main.go, utils.ts, calculator.py), suggesting a learning or demonstration purpose rather than a full-fledged application.


## Architecture

The project follows a simple, modular structure.  The `examples` directory contains language-specific example implementations. The `ai_api_helper.py` file likely provides a common interface for interacting with an external AI service, potentially used by the examples. The GitHub Actions workflows suggest an automated documentation process.


## Key Components

* **`examples/main.go`:** A Go example program.
* **`examples/utils.ts`:** A TypeScript utility file, possibly used by a separate TypeScript example (not present in the provided structure).
* **`examples/calculator.py`:** A Python example implementing a calculator.
* **`ai_api_helper.py`:** A Python module for interacting with an external AI API.  This is a crucial component for understanding the project's interaction with external services.
* **`action.yml`:**  A GitHub Action definition file, likely for a custom action.
* **`.github/workflows/auto-documentation.yml`:** A GitHub Actions workflow for automated documentation generation.


## Technology Stack

* **Go:** Used for `examples/main.go`.
* **TypeScript:** Used for `examples/utils.ts`.
* **Python:** Used for `examples/calculator.py` and `ai_api_helper.py`.
* **GitHub Actions:** Used for automated documentation and potentially other CI/CD tasks.


## Development Guidelines

* **Go:** Adhere to the official Go coding style guidelines (https://go.dev/doc/effective_go).
* **TypeScript:** Follow the TypeScript style guide (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/styleguide.html).  Consider using a linter like ESLint.
* **Python:** Use PEP 8 style guide (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Use a linter like Pylint or Flake8.


## Build & Run Instructions

Instructions are missing from the provided repository structure.  To provide specific instructions, more information is needed.  However, general approaches are:

* **Go:** `go run examples/main.go`
* **TypeScript:** `tsc examples/utils.ts` (if it's a module) or `node examples/utils.js` (if compiled).  More context is needed for a precise command.
* **Python:** `python examples/calculator.py`


## Testing Strategy

Testing strategies are not explicitly defined.  However, based on the languages used, the following approaches are recommended:

* **Go:** Use the built-in `testing` package.
* **TypeScript:** Use Jest or other testing frameworks.
* **Python:** Use `unittest` or `pytest`.


## API Documentation

No explicit API documentation is provided.  If the `ai_api_helper.py` interacts with a REST API, its documentation should be consulted separately.


## Deployment

No deployment infrastructure files (e.g., Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests) are present in the provided structure.  Deployment details are therefore unknown.
