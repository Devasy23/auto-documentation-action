# AI_CONTEXT.md

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a multi-language example demonstrating interactions with an AI API (likely for a specific task, possibly calculations or data analysis based on the presence of a `calculator.py` file).  It includes example implementations in Go, TypeScript, and Python, showcasing different approaches to interacting with a common backend AI service. The `scripts` directory suggests auxiliary tools or scripts for managing the project or interacting with the AI API. The configuration files indicate support for multiple programming languages and automated documentation generation.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture.  The `examples` directory contains language-specific example applications demonstrating the use of the AI API. The `scripts` directory houses helper scripts, likely for tasks such as API interaction management. The `config` directory holds configuration files for different programming languages, suggesting a configurable approach to interacting with the AI API or managing the build process.

## Key Components

* **`examples`:** Contains example applications in Go, TypeScript, and Python demonstrating interaction with the AI API.
    * `main.go` (Go): A main application demonstrating Go's interaction.
    * `utils.ts` (TypeScript): Utility functions for the TypeScript example.
    * `calculator.py` (Python): A Python example, potentially demonstrating a specific use case (e.g., calculations using the AI API).
* **`scripts`:** Contains helper scripts.
    * `ai_api_helper.py`: A Python script likely providing common functionality for interacting with the AI API.
    * `ai_api_helper.py` (duplicate filename, needs clarification):  This duplicate filename needs investigation to determine its purpose and if it's intentional.
* **`config`:** Contains configuration files for different languages (Go, Java, TypeScript, Python).  These files likely specify settings for the build process or API interaction.


## Technology Stack

* **Programming Languages:** Go, TypeScript, Python
* **Configuration:** JSON
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (indicated by `.github/workflows/auto-documentation.yml` and `action.yml`)


## Development Guidelines

* **Go:** Adhere to the official Go coding style guidelines.  Use `gofmt` for consistent formatting.
* **TypeScript:** Follow the TypeScript style guide and use a linter (e.g., ESLint) to enforce consistency.
* **Python:**  Use PEP 8 style guide and a linter (e.g., Pylint, Flake8) for code quality and consistency.


## Build & Run Instructions

Detailed instructions are needed, but based on the structure, a general approach would be:

* **Go:**  `go run examples/main.go` (assuming necessary dependencies are managed)
* **TypeScript:**  `tsc examples/utils.ts` (compile) followed by running the main application (command not evident from structure).
* **Python:**  `python examples/calculator.py` (assuming necessary dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a requirements file exists).


## Testing Strategy

Testing strategies are not explicitly defined, but appropriate approaches would include:

* **Go:** Use the built-in Go testing framework (`testing` package).
* **TypeScript:** Use Jest or other suitable testing frameworks.
* **Python:** Use the `unittest` module or pytest.


## API Documentation

No explicit API documentation is found in the provided structure.  If an external AI API is used, its documentation should be consulted separately.


## Deployment

No deployment infrastructure files (e.g., Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests) are present in the provided structure.  Deployment details would need to be determined separately.  The GitHub Actions workflow suggests automated documentation generation, which might be part of a broader CI/CD pipeline.
