# AI_CONTEXT.md

## Project Overview

This project appears to be a multi-language example demonstrating interactions with an AI API (likely for a specific service, judging by `ai_api_helper.py` and `scripts` directory).  The examples showcase usage in Go, TypeScript, and Python.  The `config` directory suggests configurable settings for different languages. The presence of GitHub Actions workflows (`action.yml` and `auto-documentation.yml`) indicates an automated build and documentation process.


## Architecture

The project follows a modular structure.  The `examples` directory contains illustrative programs in Go, TypeScript, and Python.  The `scripts` directory houses helper functions, particularly for interacting with the AI API (`ai_api_helper.py`). The `config` directory holds language-specific configuration files.  This suggests a loosely coupled architecture where different language examples utilize a common API interaction layer.


## Key Components

* **`examples`:** Contains example applications demonstrating the usage of the AI API in different programming languages (Go, TypeScript, Python).
* **`scripts`:** Contains reusable scripts and helper functions, notably `ai_api_helper.py` for interacting with the AI API.
* **`config`:** Contains configuration files (`go.json`, `java.json`, `typescript.json`, `python.json`) likely for customizing settings for different languages or environments.
* **`ai_api_helper.py`:**  A crucial component responsible for communication with the external AI API.


## Technology Stack

* **Programming Languages:** Go, TypeScript, Python, potentially Java (indicated by `config/java.json`).
* **Configuration:** JSON
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions


## Development Guidelines

* **Go:** Adhere to the official Go coding style guidelines.  Use `gofmt` for consistent formatting.
* **TypeScript:** Follow the TypeScript style guide and use a linter (e.g., ESLint) to enforce consistency.
* **Python:** Use PEP 8 style guide and a linter (e.g., Pylint, Flake8).


## Build & Run Instructions

The build and run instructions will vary depending on the language and example.  Further investigation of the `examples` directory is required.  However, the presence of GitHub Actions suggests automated builds.  To run individual examples:

* **Go:**  `go run main.go` (assuming `main.go` is the entry point)
* **TypeScript:** `tsc` (to compile) followed by `node <compiled_file.js>`
* **Python:** `python calculator.py` (or the appropriate Python file)


## Testing Strategy

Testing strategies should align with the chosen languages:

* **Go:** Use the built-in `testing` package.
* **TypeScript:** Use Jest or similar testing frameworks.
* **Python:** Use `unittest` or `pytest`.


## API Documentation

No explicit API documentation is found in the provided structure.  The `ai_api_helper.py` suggests interaction with an external AI API, but its specifics are unknown.  Documentation for this external API would be needed.


## Deployment

No deployment-related files (e.g., Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests) are present in the provided structure.  Deployment strategy is undefined.
